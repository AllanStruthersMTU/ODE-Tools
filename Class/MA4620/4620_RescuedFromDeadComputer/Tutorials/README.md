## What

This repo contains a set of tutorials to learn how to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in Julia with the [Gridap.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) library.

The tutorials are available in two formats:

- As jupyter notebooks, allowing an interactive learning experience. **This is the recommended way to follow the tutorials**

- As HTML pages, allowing a rapid access into the material without the need of any setup.

## How
